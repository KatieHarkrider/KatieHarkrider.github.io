            <h3>About Me:</h3>
            <p>I graduated from my dream school, The University of Texas at Austin, in 2018 with a Bachelor of Science in
                Public Relations. During my senior year, I had the opportunity to intern for Chuy's in their marketing
                department. There I learned the ins and outs of restaurant marketing from creating social media copy to
                creating posters for individual restaurants to researching the market area of a new location. I now run 8
                Facebook Pages, 4 Twitter accounts, 3 Instagram profiles, and 4 YouTube channels while assisting with
                research projects and event planning.

            <h3>A little about what I do in my spare time:</h3>
            <p>I am a die-hard sports fan. My favorite sports are football, college football specifically, and baseball.
                I bleed burnt orange, not only because I am a Texas Ex, but so is my mom! She really instilled the love
                of UT into me. We have season tickets to Texas football so you can find me at Darrel K. Royal Memorial
                Stadium every Saturday Home game, and somewhere with my dog to watch the Saturday away games! With
                baseball, I am just as into UT baseball as I am into the major league. I am a huge Atlanta Braves fan!
                You can find me watching most games on T.V. since they are so far away. My family and are trying to
                visit every baseball stadium in the U.S., and the one in Canada. I also rescued a sweet pup after
                starting my full-time job! His name is Max and he is a labrador retriever mix, he was three years old
                when I adopted him from Austin Pets Alive. He is the sweetest and silliest boy, we love to hang out at
                parks and walk the trails here in Austin.
            </p>
            <p>I come from a big and very tight-knit family! It's only me, my parents, my older brother, and my
                sister-in-law, but my mom is the youngest of 10 kids so there is no shortage of family around. We love
                to get together for birthdays, holidays, and just for fun.</p>
